# Usage

The library contains the pipelines to build the universe. You can
run the pipelines interactively in Jupyter Notebook.

```python
from fpm_universe import pipeline
```

Alternatively, for scheduled runs, you can create a configuration
and run the command line entry point to create the universe.
